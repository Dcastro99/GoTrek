Eventually, you'll see the sign for Gem Lake where you take a left and continue past a couple more views of Snow Lake, including over a log bridge. The trail takes you up again for about a mile, through another rock field and some mountain meadows until you reach Gem Lake, which rests at a higher elevation than it's much larger neighbor, Snow Lake",

This hike is a popular weekend overnight destination; so don’t expect to be by yourself in high season.The trail starts off heading uphill before you cross into the wilderness boundary. Some roots and rocks will be present, but it's just enough to get you warmed up. Once you cross the boundary into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, the trail grade eases. You will cross numerous small feeder streams as you wind your way up Box Canyon. The trail alternates between sections of old-growth, primarily douglas fir and hemlock, and brushy avalanche meadows, where the trail is crowded by salmonberry, sword ferns and devil's club. If you hike this section after an overnight rain or a dewy morning, prepare to get your legs more than a little damp.",

The vibrant blue of the glacier-fed lake provides the perfect rest stop for hikers who have braved the thirty-odd steep switchbacks that lead to the lake. The trail starts in cool second growth forest, but the trees are quite sizable. In the fall, the squirrels roughhouse in the trees high above your head. Occasionally they drop gigantic pinecones from high above, and while the resulting crash is startling, it is fun to watch.",

Suddenly, laid out beneath your feet are the icy waters of the lake — deep blue in the shade, bright aquamarine in sunlight — while high above you at the far end of the lake, the twin spires of Dragontail and Colchuck Peaks seem to crowd out the very sky. While the final ascent to the lake is steep and rough in places, Colchuck’s overall elevation gain of 2,300 feet makes its spectacular scenery accessible to hikers of almost any ability. In summer, cars fill not only the trailhead parking lot, but the road leading to it. As if Colchuck Lake alone weren’t enough of a draw, it is one of the two gateways to the Enchantments, and the trailhead also accesses Stuart Lake, an easier and equally awesome destination.",
